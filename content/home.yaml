  title: Making _diffraction_ data analysis and modelling _easy_
  description: >-
    An intuitive and user-friendly application which integrates some
    crystallographic libraries such as
    [CrysPy](https://github.com/ikibalin/cryspy) and
    [CrysFML](https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/crysfml) (experimental).
    Allowing for the simulation of diffraction patterns based on structural
    models and refinement against experimental data.

    title: Various techniques
    description: >-
      Currently, we partially support constant wavelength (CW) 1D neutron and
      X-ray powder diffraction data. Time-of-flight (TOF), polarized neutrons,
      single-crystal, 2D, and so on, will be added later.
