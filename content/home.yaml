  title: Making _diffraction_ data analysis and modelling _easy_
  description: >-
    An intuitive and user-friendly application which integrates multiple popular
    crystallographic libraries such as
    [CrysPy](https://github.com/ikibalin/cryspy),
    [CrysFML](https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/crysfml) and
    [GSAS-II](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS). Allowing for the
    simulation of diffraction patterns based on structural models and refinement
    against experimental data.

    title: Various techniques
    description: >-
      Currently, we support constant wavelength (CW) and time-of-flight (TOF) 1D
      neutron powder diffraction data. Single-crystal, 2D, and so on, will be
      added later.
